# Hey, I'm Hedrin 👋

I build crypto infrastructure products, do fun stuff with AI image generation and whatever else catches my eyes.

## What I've Built

**[Ordinal Genesis](https://ordinalgenesis.xyz)** — Leading launchpad for Ordinals on Bitcoin

**[GenesisPad](https://genesispad.xyz)** — Launchpad for EVM NFTs

**[Shovel](https://shovel.space)** — BRC-20 explorer and minting tool. Built as an MVP when the protocol dropped — full-stack work with bleeding-edge Bitcoin stuff.

**Prismify** *(discontinued)* — No-code LoRA training for Flux Schnell. Upload images, click a few buttons, get a trained model.
